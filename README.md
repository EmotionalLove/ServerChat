# ServerChat

A server-sided chat and command management system for Better Than Adventure! 1.7.7_0 (as of writing)

This mod is meant to act as a "plugin" to help manage chat and commands, and add >greentext and whatnot.

This mod also modifies BTA's cringe deathmessages, and I have plans to make them configurable and randomisable.

WIP!

https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/babric-instance-repo/releases/tag/v1.7.7.0_01 run the server "babric/fabric" JAR and use `./gradlew build` in this repo to generate a JAR file, which you will place in the `mods` folder of your fabric/babric server directory.
